# Product Price Monitoring System

> A scalable, production-grade engine for collecting, deduplicating, and acting on marketplace price changes in real-time — built for the Entrupy engineering assignment.

E-commerce businesses live or die by pricing intelligence. This system solves a real problem: tracking the same product across multiple resale platforms (Grailed, Fashionphile, 1stdibs), detecting when prices shift, and notifying downstream consumers reliably — even if the app crashes mid-delivery.

## 🚀 Getting Started: Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (installed with Python)
- Windows OS (for `start.bat` script)

### Step 1: Clone & Setup Environment
Open your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and set up your virtual space:
```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Database
This creates a blank SQLite database schema perfectly mapped to our SQLAlchemy models.
```bash
python init_db.py
```
*Expected Output: `Database tables created successfully!`*

### Step 3: Seed API Credentials
This script will instantly generate a developer authorization token in the DB required for API access.
```bash
python seed_db.py
```
> 💡 **Your API Key is:** `entrupy-intern-test-key-2026` — use this in all HTTP requests to the backend.

### Step 4: Run the Application!

**Option A: The Automatic Way (Windows)**
You don't need to manually type server execution commands. Just run the provided batch script:
```bash
.\start.bat
```
*(Or simply double-click **`start.bat`** from your File Explorer!)*
This executes both the FastAPI Backend and the Frontend Dashboard simultaneously.

**Option B: The Manual Way (Mac/Linux/Windows)**
If you prefer to start them manually, open **two separate terminal windows**.

**Terminal 1 (Backend API):**
```bash
# In the root project folder
python src/main.py
```
*Backend is now live at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (Swagger UI at `/docs`)*

**Terminal 2 (Frontend UI):**
```bash
# Navigate INTO the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Start a local web server
python -m http.server 3000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```
*Frontend is now live at: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`*

### Step 5: Ingest Sample Data
Once your browser opens the Dashboard (`http://127.0.0.1:3000`), click the **"Sync Now"** button. This will trigger the backend `/refresh` endpoint, automatically scanning and ingesting all 90 items perfectly from your `sample_products/sample_products` repository into the relational database!

#### What you'll see on the Dashboard
When the page loads, the Dashboard fires a `GET /analytics` call to your backend:
- **Canonical Products** — how many conceptually unique items exist across sources.
- **Tracked Listings** — total unique listings tracked dynamically.
- **Price Fluctuations** — count of discrete price shifts safely recorded.

## 🔌 API Documentation

All endpoints require the `X-API-Key` header:

```
X-API-Key: entrupy-intern-test-key-2026
```

Every response follows a consistent envelope:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": ..., "error": null }
```

### Health Check
```
GET /health
```
No auth required. Returns `{"success": true, "message": "API is healthy"}`. Great for checking if the server is up.

### Trigger Data Refresh
```
POST /refresh
```
Fires the local file scraping + ingestion pipeline in the background loop over your `sample_products` directory. Returns **202 immediately** — your client doesn't wait for disk I/O to finish.

### Browse & Filter Products
```
GET /products
```
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `category` | string | — | Filter by category name |
| `source` | string | — | Filter by marketplace (e.g. `Grailed`) |
| `min_price` | float | — | Minimum price filter |
| `max_price` | float | — | Maximum price filter |
| `skip` | int | 0 | Pagination offset |
| `limit` | int | 20 | Page size (max 100) |

### Product Detail
```
GET /products/{id}
```
Returns the full canonical product with all source listings and nested price history. Uses SQLAlchemy `joinedload` to avoid N+1 queries.

### Price History (Chart-Ready)
```
GET /products/{id}/history
```  
Returns a flat, chronologically sorted array of price points — designed to feed directly into charting libraries like Chart.js.

### Platform Analytics
```
GET /analytics  
```
Returns aggregated system-wide stats in a single fast query (uses `func.count()` — no Python-side aggregation).

### Register Webhook
```
POST /webhooks
```
```json
{ "target_url": "https://your-server.com/price-alerts" }
```
Once registered, your server receives a POST payload whenever any tracked product's price changes.

## 🧠 Architecture & Design Decisions

### Deduplication: The CanonicalProduct Model

The Rolex Submariner listed on Grailed and the same watch on Fashionphile are the *same product* — your analytics should reflect that. We solve this with a `CanonicalProduct` layer. The ingestion engine looks up (or creates) a single canonical record per `brand + name` pair, then attaches each marketplace's listing beneath it. This makes cross-platform price comparison a first-class citizen of out data model.

### Zero-Loss Notifications: The Transactional Outbox Pattern

Here's the tricky part of reliable webhook delivery: if we send the HTTP notification in the same thread as ingestion and the request fails — or the app crashes — we never know if the downstream system got the update.

We solved this with the **Transactional Outbox Pattern**: when a price change is detected, we write both the new `PriceHistory` row *and* a `PriceChangeEvent` record in the **exact same SQL transaction**. A separate background loop (started automatically on server boot) polls the `price_change_events` table every 5 seconds and delivers the webhook. If delivery fails, the event stays in the table for retry. Zero events can fall through the cracks.

### Scaling Price History to Millions of Rows

We put a composite index on `(source_listing_id, timestamp DESC)` on the `PriceHistory` table. This gives O(log N) lookup time for any product's price trend — instead of a full table scan. When this grows beyond SQLite's comfortable limits, partitioning by month in PostgreSQL is the obvious next migration.

### Idempotent Ingestion

If you scrape the same product 50 times in an hour and the price hasn't changed, the database stays clean — no duplicate rows. We only write a new `PriceHistory` entry when the price *actually* differs from the most recent one. 

### Unified Data Ingestion: LocalFileScraper

To eliminate scraper class redundancies against identically structured objects, the system implements a strict, solid `LocalFileScraper`. At execution, `/refresh` parses your internal directory files on the fly asynchronously via threadpools and directly parses JSON structures to map to database models without defining hundreds of manual routing overrides.

### Frontend Architecture (Modular SRP)

The frontend follows Single Responsibility Principle as strictly as the backend:
- `config.js` — constants only
- `api.js` — all HTTP calls, nothing else
- `components.js` — pure render functions, zero API calls
- `views/` — per-screen orchestration
- `router.js` — navigation mapping only
- `app.js` — bootstrap entry point only

### Extending to 100+ Data Sources
Right now, `LocalFileScraper` handles multiple local files gracefully. To extend to 100+ live HTTP sources:
1. **Abstract Interface:** Currently, scrapers inherit from `ScraperBase(ABC)`. We'd enforce standard implementations for HTTP proxies, headers, and anti-bot evasion.
2. **Distributed Queueing:** Instead of a simple `BackgroundTasks` loop, I would implement `Celery` + `Redis` or AWS SQS. Each distinct data source (Grailed, eBay, StockX) would be assigned its own async worker queue so that one slow source doesn't block the rest.
3. **Category Normalization Pipeline:** Because 100+ sites will name categories differently, the `_normalize_category` function boils diverse strings down into broad constants ("Belts", "Apparel"). This mapping matrix would be isolated into an NLP service layer.

### Known Limitations
- **Authentication**: `X-API-Key` is static and sent as a raw header. In production, I would deploy OAuth2 or JWTs with expirations.
- **Database Scaling**: SQLite `WAL` mode handles local concurrency nicely, but for serious reads/writes, migrating to a Dockerized PostgreSQL instance is mandatory.
- **Polling Webhooks**: Right now the Outbox dispatcher polls the DB every 5 seconds. In real applications, I would use PostgreSQL `LISTEN/NOTIFY` or Redis Pub/Sub to instantly dispatch events without polling.

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```
*( Integration tests covering idempotency, authentication, and price detection are implemented in the `tests/` directory. )*

**The 8 Sample Test Cases implemented:**
1. **`test_api_auth_failure`:** Verifies returning 401 Unauthorized securely when missing or providing incorrect `X-API-Key`.
2. **`test_api_products_list_and_filter`:** Ensures filtering products by brand/category matches DB correctly.
3. **`test_api_product_detail_and_history`:** Verifies canonical product details reliably join with nested price graphs and source listings.
4. **`test_api_analytics`:** Verifies aggregated count accuracy for dashboard metric pipelines.
5. **`test_ingestion_creates_canonical_and_listings`:** Guarantees scraping an unseen product creates the root canonical tracker and child list perfectly.
6. **`test_ingestion_updates_existing_listing`:** Verifies **idempotency** — an identically priced second scrape doesn't bloat the database, but a shifted price effectively creates a secondary `PriceHistory` entry.
7. **`test_outbox_creates_events_on_price_change`:** Verifies Outbox behavior: Initial scrapes DO NOT create price shift triggers. But identical listings with a newly discovered dropped price create a `pending` event trigger perfectly.
8. **`test_webhook_delivery_failure_recovery`:** Mocks `httpx.post` failure internally to prove our background webhook dispatcher recovers cleanly and leaves the event as `pending` indefinitely rather than crashing the thread.
